## Contributions are Welcome

Try the scripts out, verify whether or not they work. If you see room for improvement, you're welcome to submit an issue and/or a PR.

## Feature Proposals

1. Make the settings configurable using a `.env` file
2. Allow users to specify the location of a pre-existing `install.iso` to speed up the creation process
3. Create a basic website (ie gh-pages) with the instructions
4. Share hardware-specific configuration notes (ie as Markdown files)
5. Make it so the configuration files can are displayed and easily navigated via the website.

Feel free to start work on any one (or more) of these challenges. With your help this tool can be made accessible to 'mere mortals'.

## Style Guide

The bash script portions are painfully obvious so there isn't much point in obsessing over style.

For the website portion, generating a layout via Yeoman would be ideal. Preferably, using Angular2 + Bootstrap. With a custom `<markdown>` HTML element.

- tabs_or_spaces: 2 spaces
- js style: [SemiStandard](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard)
- small commits: make each change it's own commit, don't mix features and style

Most importantly, have fun.
